## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a text editor using PWA. In the process of completing this challenge, I learned how to create a service worker and how to build out webpack.config.js with having to set up various plugins (HtmlWebpackPlugin, InjectManifest, WebpackPwaManifest) and modules such as babel-loader.

## Installation 

Open in VS code or a similiar program. Type npm install, then npm run build, then npm run start: dev, and finally open a webpage on localhost:3000 to view it from a local computer. Otherwise, look at the deployed provdied in the link below.
